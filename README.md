## Registered C-scans via R-SLAM. 

![MATLAB](assets/matlabvis.gif)
## Example of arbitrary surface slice for retinal volume. This MATLAB-based visualizer responds to user clicks and drags with no lag.

![mipexample](assets/mip_demo.gif)
## Registered volume visualized in three.js software using maximum intensity projection (MIP).

![isoexample](assets/iso_demo.gif)
## Registered volume visualized in three.js software using isosurfaces (ISO).

![isoexample](assets/iso_demo_intensity_threshold.gif)
## Registered volume visualized in three.js software using isosurfaces (ISO). Visualizer includes intensity thresholding feature. Increasing the intensity threshold highlights brighter features in the retinal volume including cone cells.
